# Ledger Xmas Contest

A little late, but this is my attempt at creating a program to crack the Ledger 2019 Christmas Puzzle. It consists of two parts: main.py, which is used to derive valid mnemonic phrases from the words found in the Ledger video, and checker.py, which is used to check those phrases against the blockchain.

In order to begin, open a terminal or command prompt window, navigate to the repository folder, and type:  
  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  
Once the requirements are installed for this program, you can simply type:
  
```
python main.py
```
  
The program will run through!
